* Made choice of required ``ObservationInfo`` properties configurable
  through ``RawIngestTask.getObservationInfoSubsets``.
* Added the concept of "dependency" records to be added to the registry before
  adding the exposure record; this makes it easier to satisfy foreign key
  constraints when the exposure relates to dimensions beyond the standard set.
* Added ``RawIngestTask`` methods ```makeExposureRecord` and ``makeDependencyRecords``
  to provide hooks for subclasses to provide values for additional columns.
