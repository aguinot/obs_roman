`~lsst.obs.base.FilterDefinitions` no longer supports `~lsst.afw.image.Filter`.
The ``defineFilters`` and ``reset`` methods have been removed, as have all wavelength parameters to the `~lsst.obs.base.FilterDefinition` constructor.

The old ``filter`` component for exposures has been removed, and replaced with a new ``filter`` component backed by `~lsst.afw.image.FilterLabel`.
